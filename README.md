That very first tutorial

Well here we are. Who would have thought I'd ever delve into GitHub, but it's as good a place to start as any.
I'm 30-something, curious about code and also intimidated by it. London is home, but I've lived on a few different continents.
I like dangly earrings, coffee, nail polish and interesting people. My favourite colour is emerald green.
